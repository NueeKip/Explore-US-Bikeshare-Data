### Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data Analysis
This is a project facilitated by Udacity it contains data that is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain columns and data to work on

### Description
This project contains the python script is written for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
#Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
./Bikeshare.py
#other required files
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv
washington.csv

##How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.

##Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND. Under the permission of Udacity, I have uploaded a copy of the datasets here. The file sizes are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, so they were uploaded on Google Drive instead. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.
